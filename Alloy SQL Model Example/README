This example demonstrates basic functionality of a model using an SQL facility.  I created this example to better understand how to work with models and events.

One thing I haven't been able to figure out is how to delete an entire collection without looping through each and every single record.  It's easy enough to delete a single record given some context (reference by ID).  Also still trying to figure out how to correctly create an "AUTOINCREMENT" type attribute.  It appears as though when a model is created, it will create an "id" automatically.  My attempts to create a model attribute "icon_id" that automatically creates a unique identifier when created, does not work based on the examples I found in the Q&A forums..

TBC!!
